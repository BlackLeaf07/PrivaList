If you find yourself tired of being tracked down so that every person you don't know can access your IP, your location, e-mail, real name, birth date, family members, medical concerns, political view, religion... **Here's the list for you.** 
Here's a list of websites, applications and extensions to use to stop being tracked by every damn person on this planet.
If you care about your privacy, here you go.

Any item on this list is either free of charge, either said that it's paid. Nothing hidden anymore.

**Some important things to remember:**
- Your OS is the biggest security breach you can face if you're aware of online privacy concerns.
- Intel and AMD have backdoors on their CPU that makes even your hardware vulnerable.
- 100% privacy is almost impossible, if you're not willing to have a custom OS or a Linux kernel with custom packages on it and no interactions that can track you from IRL to Online or vice-versa, running on a hand-made CPU. These advices just are ways to lessen your digital footprint.
